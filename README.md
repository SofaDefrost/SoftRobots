# SoftRobots plugin for SOFA
This plugin for SOFA contains components dedicated to soft robotics. You can find for example, models for cable and pneumatic actuations, tools to define trajectories for the robot's end effector, or tools to communicate with microcontroller boards.
Please refer to the dedicated [documentation](https://project.inria.fr/softrobot/install-get-started-2/) for installation and build. You can explore the *docs* directory in this repository to find examples and tutorials.

## Templates
The plugin also provides scene templates that can be used to make the writing of SOFA scene more easy. These templates are used in many of our examples, and can be found in the *python* directory.   
A dedicated documentation can be found at this address: [https://softrobots.readthedocs.io](https://softrobots.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)  
And general templates for SOFA can be found at this address: [https://github.com/SofaDefrost/STLIB](https://github.com/SofaDefrost/STLIB)
