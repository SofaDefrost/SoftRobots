Show case of tutorials

0- Outline :
      description of the robot / show demo
      why us ? because very good approximation, real time/interactive, inverse!!!
      content of the tutorial / simple simulation, why? / later real stuff
      FEM
      dynamic / static
T1- Elements : tetra/hexa/beam
      three simulations (just show/mention)
      hands on tetra simulation
T2- How to mesh (just show/mention)
      CAD to simulation
      make it beautiful: visual model / mapping
T3- Setup material properties: elastic/hyperelastic
      two simulations (just mention)
      hands on elastic simulation
T4- Direct actuation : cable/pressure/sliding/hydraulic
      simulation with sliding
      python controller
      connection with real robot
T5- Inverse simulation
      see T5 for connection
      communication between two simulations (direct/inverse) (just mention?)
T6- Collision (just mention and show demos)
      environment
      direct and inverse (show show show)
      demo with a real obstacle (fixed, not tracked)
T7- From simplified to very good model
      how to attach deformable to rigid
T8- Closed loop
T9- Conclusion and perspectives
      model order reduction
      friction
      contact GPU
