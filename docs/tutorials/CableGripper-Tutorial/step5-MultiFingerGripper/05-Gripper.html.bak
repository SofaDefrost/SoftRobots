		<h1>Step 5: Soft gripper robot</h1>
		
		<p>In the previous steps, we showed the simulation of a single finger made of elastic material. But the orginal soft gripper robot is composed of three fingers actuated with cables. 
		In the design of Taimoor Hassan et al., a single cable is used for the three fingers. We simulate that by applying the same control input to three cable actuators placed on the three fingers</p>
		<p> In the file SoftGripper_directControl.pyscn, we put 3 finger models (instead of 1) by copy/paste of the previous simulation </p>
		<p> A <FONT COLOR="#0B2161">PythonScriptController</font> is placed at the root node of the graph to interactively change the inputs of 3 
		the <FONT COLOR="#0B2161">CableConstraint</font>  components. Here, we use a control of the actuator (direct simulation).
		</p>

		<h2>How to use the demo</h2>
		<p> After clicking on "Animate" you can click in the 3d view then pulling/releasing the three cables by pressing CTRL+  and CTLR-.</p>
